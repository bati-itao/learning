						<p>What if I told you these stairs were accessible?</p>
						<p>Would you believe me?</p>
						<p>If so, why?</p>
						<p>If not, it depends, for the following reasons:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>it's not for a person in a wheelchair</li>
							<li>there's a break mid way, for people that need a rest</li>
							<li>there's a long hand rail that goes the whole length of the stairs, helps blind people know when the stairs start, where there is a level part and when they stop</li>
							<li>there is a high contrast end to each step to help people with low vision see the steps better</li>
							<li>at the start of the stairs, there are pumps in the steps to tell a person using a cain to guide them that there's a ledge</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This shows you that sometimes we might see something that's not accessible for a certain type of disability but it actually is accessible for a large number of people. Our job is to make sure we make things accessible for as many people as possible. And if we can give other options to those people that can't access the information</p>
						<p>Example, would be a interactive map, a blind user can't move things around but if you give them all the information in text, they can easily search the page for what they are looking for.</p>

						<h1>Google bot is disabled</h1>
						<p>Excerpt from George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four</p>
						<blockquote>
							&ldquo;<p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from enteringalong with him.</p>
							<p>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster,too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.</p>
							<p>Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do withthe production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.&rdquo;</p>
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Does anyone know what the google bot does?</p>
							<p>It indexes (reads) web pages so people can search for word and find them. The bot can't see so it works the same way a screen reader works for non-sighted people. If a website is not accessible, than the bot can't read the information on the site and doesn't index it, therefor making the site non-searchable. This applies to all the other search engines</p>

						<p>WCAG is the guidelines created by the organization that writes the standards for coding the web. These are the standards that if followed will make your code more accessible. The guide is long and has a lot of information in it but it's very important to understand it if you're going to create code for the web.</p>
